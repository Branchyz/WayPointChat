# "start" is how long it takes in minutes to broadcast for the first time.
# With "start" you can time the broadcasts, so that they don't all broadcast at the same time.
# "interval" is the amount of time in minutes between broadcasts.
# "world" is an optional parameter, if set, the message will only be sent to players in that world.
